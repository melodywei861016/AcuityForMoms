OPSEC is the actions and behaviors required to maintain security and anonymity.\nWe look at live operating systems, what they are, which are the best ones, and how they can be used for security, privacy, and anonymity. \nYou will gain a complete understanding of how to use virtual private networks (or VPNs) for security, privacy and to attempt anonymity. Everything from choosing a provider to preventing protocol leaks. \nWe fully explore the anonymising service and darknet known as Tor. What are its weaknesses and what you can do to mitigate those weaknesses to improve your anonymity and security when you are using Tor. Including exploring the use of virtual and hardware routers and gateways.\nYou will learn how proxies servers are used for privacy and hiding your IP address. You will understand the difference between the various types of proxies, what they are suitable for, and importantly learn about their many weaknesses.\nWe cover how to use the extremely versatile SSH protocol for optimal security, privacy, and anonymity. Covering local, remote and dynamic port forwarding. Authentication and hardening.\nYou will understand the i2p darknet and how to best use it with optimal configuration to protect your security and anonymity.\nWe look at other privacy and anonymizing services too such as JonDoNym, botnets, and bulletproof hosting services.\nWe cover in detail how censorship can be circumvented by learning how to bypass firewalls, proxies, deep packet inspection technology and nation state censorship.\nThen we learn the more advanced methods of anonymization by exploring nesting and chaining anonymizing services together. You will understand their strengths, weaknesses and what each chaining method is suitable for.\nYou will understand how to use off-site connections such as Wi-Fi hotspots and Internet cafes for privacy and anonymity. How to use them securely and anonymously even against a well-resourced adversary with global influence.\nWe cover how to use cellular networks for privacy and anonymity. You will understand the inherent weaknesses of cellular networks and how to use them best for privacy and anonymity.\nFor each section, you will learn both the theory and how to step by step setup each method.\nA certificate of completion is available signed by the instructor Nathan House so CPE credits can be claimed.

(Six months of dental surgery and he MIGHT be able to talk and actually stand trial.)\nIncredible \u201cmilitary tricks\u201d that will take you from absolute rookie to a master fighter in just a few short hours.\nWhy a simple change in your \u201cmindset\u201d will mean the difference between being the prey or being the predator when surrounded by thugs, gang members and other scum on the street.\nHow to snatch a loaded gun right out of a \"Gangsta's\" hand so damn fast it will literally tear his trigger finger off! (And then immediately\u2014without even thinking about it\u2014cave his chest in without skipping a beat.)\nHow to immediately win a fight if you find yourself on the ground with a bigger opponent on top of you. (And without screwing around with that \"tap-out\" B.S. you see on TV.)\nHow to control the \u201cshakes\u201d and super-hot adrenaline dump that occurs during tense, violent situations! (You\u2019ll be cool, smooth and effective no matter how confusing things get... just the opposite of how most men react!)\nThe one \u201cbasic\u201d mistake even cops and soldiers make (despite their expensive training) that erases their \"training advantage\" in a street fight. (And how to make sure YOU never fall victim to it yourself.)\nHow to get away from a larger attacker who surprises you. (It's instantaneous, keeps you safe from any blows, and puts him so \"off-balanced\" he's toast for your next move. And the beauty is... the bigger he is, the easier it is for you to do this!)\nThe 8 \u201ctactical\u201d combat coordinates you must know to win a violent encounter against any attacker\u2014including the horrendous \u201cHollywood\u201d mistakes most people make that get them seriously hurt or killed. (Some of the \u201cnormal tendencies\u201d you have are 100% wrong!)\nVicious, stomach-churning (but simple) moves that allow you to \"lead\" him by his chin all the way to the ground... hard.
